Electricity-Billing-System-Project

The Java project on Electricity Bill Management System using Java Swing concepts creates a desktop application to manage electricity billing. It features a user-friendly interface for inputting customer details, recording meter readings, calculating bills, and generating printable statements.

There are two aspects of this application â€“ Admin and Customer.

The admin can create a new customer with new meter information assigned to the customer, view all customer details, and calculate the bills of all the customers.

It lets User perform multiple operations like:-

1- User can Signup and create account to track all bill details.

2- User can Calculate and pay their Electricity Bill .

3- User can update their own personal details.

4- User can Generate Bill.

5- User can see their meter info and the payment status of the bill.
